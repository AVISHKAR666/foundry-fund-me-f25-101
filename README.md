ðŸš€ FundMe Smart Contract Project

I built a crowdfunding-style smart contract in Solidity where anyone can send ETH to fund the project, but with some key features:



ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Minimum Funding Requirement â†’ Contributors must send a minimum amount of ETH, calculated using Chainlink price feeds to keep the value consistent in USD (e.g., $50).

Data Tracking â†’ Every funderâ€™s contribution is stored in a mapping + array, so the contract keeps track of who funded and how much.

Withdrawal Function â†’ Only the owner (deployer) of the contract can withdraw all the funds safely.

Price Conversion Library â†’ A helper PriceConverter library was written to fetch ETH/USD prices and convert ETH values.

Mock Testing Setup â†’ Since real price feeds arenâ€™t available locally, a MockV3Aggregator was deployed for testing.



ðŸ”¹ Testing & Deployment (using Foundry)

DeployFundMe.s.sol â†’ Script to deploy the contract.

HelperConfig.s.sol â†’ Chooses between real Chainlink price feeds (on live/testnets) and mock contracts (on local testing).

Comprehensive unit tests ensured the funding logic, withdrawal security, and data updates worked as expected.



ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Solidity

Foundry (Forge for testing, Cast for interaction, Anvil for local blockchain)

Chainlink Price Feeds

Mock contracts for simulation.
